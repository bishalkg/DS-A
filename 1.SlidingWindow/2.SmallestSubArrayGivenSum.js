/*
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S,’ find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0 if no such subarray exists.



Time Complexity#
The time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N). The outer for loop runs for all elements, and the inner while loop processes each element only once; therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm will be O(N+N), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N).

Space Complexity#
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
